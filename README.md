In this file at the home page we wrote something about weather forecasting which is not very important but its my project for my college so i have to write something.

Home page part 3
Now from below there the main thing the weather prediction system here you have to enter any state and it will give the current weather condition
Note that we take data from 3/11/22 to 4/11/22 so it gives result according to data only for 5/11/22.
So it basically use preivious data and on the basis of that it will give output of the current date for that we have to update the data regularly but as this is only a project to use my learning i didn't maintain it for long duration.
I use ML linear regression model for the prediction in which it tries to findout the pattern of the previous weather and try to predict the current weather
we already stored the predicted data in the Datas table of our database so if user want the current data the website has to search only the state in the database it don't have to calculate it so it saves so much time
